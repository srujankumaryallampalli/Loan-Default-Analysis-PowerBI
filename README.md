# Loan Default Analysis – End-to-End Power BI Project

This is an in-depth data visualization and analytics project built using **Power BI**, aimed at exploring patterns and trends related to **loan defaults**. The goal of the project is to help financial institutions identify risk-prone customer segments and take data-driven decisions to reduce default rates.

---

##  Project Structure

- `Loan_Default_Report.pbix` – Main Power BI report file  
- `Screenshots/` – Contains visuals of the final dashboards  
- `README.md` – Project documentation (this file)  
- `Data/` – A sample dataset 

---

##  Objective

To develop a dynamic and insightful dashboard that enables stakeholders to analyze:
- Which applicant segments are more likely to default
- How loan amounts and incomes vary across demographics
- Year-over-year (YOY) trends in loan disbursement and defaults

This project simulates a real-world BI use case in the financial sector.
